<h3 id = "intro">Introduction of Application</h3>
<h4>Creators of the application</h4>
<p>Into the Unknown is an application developed by a team of 3 students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The team consists of Pulavarthi Shravya, Tan Le Xuan Tricia and Teo Wei Jie.</p>
<h4>About Into the Unknown & Purpose</h4>
<p>This application aims to connect both foreigners and locals to view and explore the 300+ local parks in Singapore.Users can also discover the hidden gems of the parks and re-discover areas that they have never been to.The application will be available to the public in Google Play Store only.</p>
<h4>Application Icon</h4>
<img src = "app icon.jpg" width = "200" height = "200">
<p>Into the Unknown's app icon! The application icon is mainly made of much greenery to represent the nature, which is what the application is all about.</p>

<br>

<h3 id = "target">Target Audience</h3>
<h4>Who are our main users of the application?</h4>
<p>There are many who love going to the park to involve themselves in various activities from babies till senior citizens. So who are our target audience? As mentioned earlier, our main purpose of the application is for people to explore the various parts of Singpore that they have never been to.</p>
<p>Hence, our target audience would mainly be:</p>
<img src = "natureLover.jpg" width = "200" height = "200">
<p>Nature lovers/Adventures</p>

<br>

<p>However, our application is not only limited to them. Others can also use our application as we do have features that cater to them by showing the available facilities/activities at the various parks. Hence, along with nature lovers/adventure seekers our application also caters to the following groups too!</p>
<img src="family.jpg" alt="Forest" width = "200" height = "200">
<p>Families</p>
<img src="exercise.jpg" alt="Mountains" width = "200" height = "200">
<p>People who exercise at parks</p>

<br>

<h3 id = "race">Our Main Competitor</h3>
<p>From our search in Google Play Store, our only competitor is NParks Coast to Coast. This application shows users the coastal trail for hikers to hike from their location to Coney Island only.</p>
<h4>Drawbacks of our Competitiors</h4>
<p>The application displays parks available. However it does not display all the 300+ parks available in Singapore. Moreover, this app (in our opinion) only caters to 1 group of people -> Adventure Seekers. Families and those who love to exercise at the park would not find this application useful and would not really cater to their needs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has not been given a very positive review due to often "hanging" of application and "irregularities". Adding on, users have said that is does not have "minimum useability to start apps". This shows that many are very unhappy with the application.</p>

<p>Looking at these reviews, we have decided to create the application to tackle them and give interested users a better experience to discover Singapore.</p>
